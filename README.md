# BIOF501A Project: Taxonomic Classification of the Microbiome in Surviving Colorectal Cancer Patients using the DADA2 Pipeline

#### By: Michael Yoon

# Introduction:
#### Disclaimer - Sequences were obtained from the NCBI SRA archive as part of the study "The local tumor microbiome is associated with survival in late-stage colorectal cancer patients" [1].

In 2018, colorectal cancer was reported as one of the most common types of diagnosed cancers ranking 3rd in incidence and 2nd in mortality world wide [2]. The disease is characterized by a variety of symptoms including: blood in stool, fatigue, abdominal pain, and loss of apetite [3]. 

In recent times, research has shown how the gut microbiome is associated with the tumour microenvironment where certain bacterial strains were identified to be potentially procarinogenic based on their role in producing harmful products during the metabolism [4]. For these reasons, identifying these bacterial strains related to colorectal cancer development is necessary in developing treatment methods targetting the gut microbiome.
